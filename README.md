## What needs to be done

- Be a hacker: find a way to successfully run the app and get the right JSON output from the API endpoint /v1/auth/ - hint: no code change needed (but think of Composer + check Laravel doc https://laravel.com/docs/9.x).
- Be a saviour: fix a bug in the app. /v1/auth/debug?lang=fr should return a JSON with a `language` key containing the string "Français".
- Be a builder: add a new API endpoint to the app and fetch some external API data as JSON. Example, from: https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke.
